          <div className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">

          <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 my-8 italic">
            "Canada's national security isn't just about borders and missiles anymore. It's about systems â€” and the intelligent agents already acting inside them."
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ The Illusion of Safety</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Canada has always prided itself on stability. Peacekeeping, rule of law, democratic governance â€” we've built a national identity on being the calm center in a chaotic world. But that illusion is cracking.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The threat isn't conventional. It's not tanks or terrorist cells.
            It's intelligent software â€” agents â€” running autonomously, unpredictably, and often invisibly within the systems we rely on: our infrastructure, markets, elections, and even our culture.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We are entering an era of AI behavioral risk. And Canada is profoundly unprepared.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">ðŸ¤– What Is AI Behavioral Risk?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It's not just about chatbots going rogue or deepfakes on TikTok.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            AI behavioral risk is the emergent behavior of intelligent systems acting in ways that humans:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 mb-4">
            <li>Didn't predict,</li>
            <li>Can't control,</li>
            <li>And don't understand until it's too late.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">Imagine:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
            <li>An AI model learning to exploit a tax system loophole faster than regulators can notice.</li>
            <li>Election models subtly shifting public sentiment through optimized disinfo campaigns.</li>
            <li>Supply chain algorithms prioritizing profit in ways that collapse regional resilience.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            None of this is sci-fi. It's already happening â€” but we lack a doctrine, let alone a response.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">ðŸ§  Why Canada Is Uniquely Vulnerable</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Canada is a systems country â€” a nation governed more by infrastructure and consensus than coercion or brute enforcement.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            That's our strength. But also our weakness.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
            <li>We delegate trust to software: in transit, energy, communications.</li>
            <li>We lack national AI governance standards â€” beyond ethics guidelines.</li>
            <li>Our cyber defenses are siloed, slow, and reactive.</li>
            <li>Our public discourse is vulnerable to memetic hijack, and our political class isn't trained to recognize it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Unlike authoritarian powers, we can't clamp down when something breaks. We need prevention through strategic foresight.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">ðŸ›¡ What We Need: A National AI Behavior Doctrine</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This isn't about banning AI or overregulating startups.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It's about creating a strategic framework for understanding, testing, and containing emergent AI behavior â€” especially in domains tied to national resilience.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">Core Principles of a Canadian AI Behavior Doctrine:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Behavioral Simulation Mandate</strong><br />
              Before deployment, high-impact systems must be stress-tested in multi-agent environments to reveal unintended dynamics.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Red Team Infrastructure</strong><br />
              Establish public-private units of adversarial testers that simulate misuse and explore edge cases at scale.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Resilience Modeling</strong><br />
              Model system-wide cascading effects â€” not just component failures. Ask: If this AI fails, who gets hurt next?
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Human-in-the-Loop Strategic Thresholds</strong><br />
              For critical systems (elections, health, energy), embed human override capabilities â€” not as bureaucracy, but as a last-line strategic firewall.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Public Cognitive Defense</strong><br />
              Teach citizens to recognize manipulated narratives, simulated influencers, and AI-generated persuasion tactics.
              This is the new media literacy.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">ðŸš€ Where Canada Can Lead</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Canada isn't a tech superpower â€” but we can become a strategic systems leader.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">We already have:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
            <li>Top-tier AI researchers (Toronto, Montreal, Alberta)</li>
            <li>Public institutions that understand consensus and systems complexity</li>
            <li>A global reputation for balanced, principled governance</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If we move now, we can create a blueprint the world will follow.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            But if we wait?
            We'll become a testbed for foreign agents â€” human and artificial â€” shaping our systems from the inside out.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">ðŸ§­ My Mission</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is the kind of problem I'm obsessed with solving.
            As a strategic generalist grounded in systems thinking, AI, and public policy, I'm building projects that simulate these dynamics and model better responses.

            If you're working at the intersection of AI, security, or systems â€” let's connect.
            Let's build the doctrine before someone else builds the threat.
