      <p>
        Since its late 2024 launch, the "Work with Apps" feature on the ChatGPT macOS app has transformed how users interact with AI on their desktop. By granting accessibility permissions, users can let ChatGPT read on-screen content from supported apps, making the assistant context-aware and eliminating the need for constant copy-pasting. Whether you're coding, writing, or troubleshooting, this feature acts as an invisible co-pilot, pulling in relevant content from whatever app you're using and using it to generate more intelligent, immediate responses.
      </p>

      <p>
        What began as a tool focused on developer environments has rapidly expanded into a versatile productivity assistant. As of early 2025, a broad array of macOS applications are now natively supported. This essay outlines the major categories of supported apps, explaining how ChatGPT integrates with each and what users can expect.

      <h2>Note-Taking and Writing Tools</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most practical uses of ChatGPT on Mac is its seamless interaction with text-based applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Notes:</strong> ChatGPT can read the full content of any open note and respond based on that context. Highlighted text receives extra attention, making summarization, rewriting, or note analysis easy and fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Notion:</strong> Entire pages within the Notion desktop app can be read by ChatGPT. You can ask for summaries, rewrites, or enhancements to selected blocks of text.</li>
        <li><strong>Quip:</strong> Similar to Notion and Notes, Quip documents are fully accessible. Editing suggestions or grammar fixes are generated in real time based on the text currently open.</li>
        <li><strong>TextEdit:</strong> Both plain and rich text documents are supported. Whether you're jotting down ideas or editing Markdown or HTML, ChatGPT can function as a real-time writing assistant by drawing from the open file.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr className="my-8" />

      <h2>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Code Editors</h2>
      <p>
        For developers, the Work with Apps feature is a game-changer. ChatGPT acts as a pair programmer or code reviewer by analyzing what's in your editor window.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Xcode:</strong> ChatGPT reads open source files in Apple's IDE. You can highlight code or errors and get suggestions or bug fixes without needing to copy and paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Studio Code:</strong> With the ChatGPT extension installed, VS Code becomes fully integrated. Not only can ChatGPT read files, it can suggest changes and generate diffs that can be directly applied inside the editor.</li>
        <li><strong>VS Code Variants (Insiders, VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf):</strong> These forks and AI-focused versions of VS Code enjoy the same support as standard VS Code, enabling broad flexibility in tooling.</li>
        <li><strong>JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.):</strong> Without needing any plugins, ChatGPT can access open code files in JetBrains-based apps and offer detailed feedback, explanations, or rewrites—perfect for everything from Java to Python to SQL.</li>
        <li><strong>BBEdit and Nova:</strong> Whether using BBEdit's robust plain text environment or Panic's Nova editor, ChatGPT pulls in the visible file and responds to questions or editing tasks like cleaning up code, fixing syntax, or improving prose.</li>
        <li><strong>TextMate and Script Editor:</strong> These lightweight macOS tools are also supported. ChatGPT helps review AppleScript, JavaScript, or shell scripts, making it especially useful for automation workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>MATLAB:</strong> MATLAB script files (.m) are accessible for analysis. Ask ChatGPT to debug or optimize code, and it will use the content of the open script to assist intelligently.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr className="my-8" />

      <h2>Terminal and Command-Line Utilities</h2>
      <p>
        ChatGPT also works in the command-line space, helping users understand shell output and debug commands:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>macOS Terminal:</strong> ChatGPT can read the last ~200 lines of terminal output, letting it explain errors, summarize logs, or guide command use—all while you stay focused on the CLI.</li>
        <li><strong>iTerm2:</strong> This third-party terminal enjoys the same support as Apple's Terminal. Developers can seamlessly get explanations or insights from complex terminal output in real time.</li>
        <li><strong>Warp:</strong> A next-gen terminal with built-in AI tools, Warp is still compatible with ChatGPT, allowing users to toggle between native and ChatGPT interpretations of shell sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> Panic's Prompt SSH client is now supported too. Whether you're tailing logs or managing servers remotely, ChatGPT can read and analyze what you're seeing in your terminal buffer.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr className="my-8" />

      <h2>How It Works & Tips for Use</h2>
      <p>
        To activate this feature:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open ChatGPT's macOS app.</li>
        <li>Go to Settings → Work with Apps.</li>
        <li>Enable access for each app you want ChatGPT to interact with.</li>
        <li>Ensure Accessibility permissions are granted in macOS system preferences.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Once enabled, you can invoke ChatGPT using a global shortcut (default: Option + Space). The assistant will automatically read the content of the foreground app—either the whole document or the selected text—and incorporate it into its response. For privacy, it only reads apps you've explicitly authorized, and you can revoke access at any time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pro tip: when working in apps like VS Code, Notes, or Terminal, highlight only the part you want ChatGPT to focus on for more precise results.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The "Work with Apps" feature has turned ChatGPT from a standalone assistant into a fully integrated part of the macOS ecosystem. From development environments and note-taking apps to terminal emulators, ChatGPT now works in real time across your most important workflows. As of 2025, it supports more than two dozen widely-used apps, with support expected to grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        By embedding itself inside your actual working environment, ChatGPT eliminates friction—allowing you to think, write, code, and analyze faster than ever. For developers, writers, and knowledge workers alike, this feature marks a leap forward in what desktop AI can do.
