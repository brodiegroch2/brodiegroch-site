            Systems. Strategy. Execution.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I&apos;m Brodie Groch, a 23-year-old Canadian strategist based in Calgary, Alberta ‚Äî where I&apos;m building a career at the intersection of national systems, AI behavior, and political operations.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I don&apos;t come from politics or Silicon Valley.<br />
            I come from a mindset:<br />
            ‚Üí that the most important systems in a country are the least visible<br />
            ‚Üí that strategy is a skill, not a title<br />
            ‚Üí and that the future belongs to operators who can think clearly, act quickly, and build resiliently.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">üéØ What I&apos;m Focused On</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I&apos;m building a portfolio of small but sharp public strategy projects ‚Äî not because I&apos;m trying to impress, but because it&apos;s how I think best:
            in public, under pressure, and through systems.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">Right now, I&apos;m focused on:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-2">
            <li>AI Behavior + Risk ‚Äî understanding how intelligent agents impact national resilience</li>
            <li>Strategic Political Infrastructure ‚Äî from election modeling to memetic defense</li>
            <li>Civic Systems Thinking ‚Äî analyzing and improving the strategic design of Canadian infrastructure, governance, and tech policy</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">üìö My Background</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I hold a Bachelor&apos;s in Management from UBCO, and I&apos;m currently entering the Mechanical Engineering Technology program at SAIT (Fall 2025). That may sound like a strange combo ‚Äî but that&apos;s the point.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I study how things work.<br />
            People, systems, structures, loops.<br />
            From political power to machine design.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I co-own a small Canadian company (GOAT Distributors Inc.) and have worked across education, logistics, and entrepreneurship. Every role I&apos;ve taken on has had one common theme:
            take chaos and turn it into structure.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">üß† Why Strategy?</h2>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Because strategy is leverage. It&apos;s the ability to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Spot what others miss</li>
            <li>Act before the signal becomes obvious</li>
            <li>Build something that lasts beyond your direct control</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I&apos;m drawn to high-stakes domains ‚Äî not for the adrenaline, but for the clarity they demand.<br />
            Domains where:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-2">
            <li>Bad strategy costs real people real things</li>
            <li>Systems fail in complex, not obvious, ways</li>
            <li>You don&apos;t get a second shot</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-6">
            This site is a public record of what I&apos;m thinking, building, and exploring.<br />
            If you&apos;re working in AI, public policy, defense, or national infrastructure ‚Äî and you think Canada should play smarter in the next 5‚Äì10 years ‚Äî we should talk.
