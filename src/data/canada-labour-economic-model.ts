    introduction: "Canada's contemporary economic strategy has prioritized gross domestic product (GDP) growth through rapid population increases and mass higher education attainment. This approach – heavily reliant on high immigration levels and credentialism – has succeeded in expanding aggregate GDP, yet has done little to raise real wages or improve productivity and prosperity on a per-person basis. Real GDP per capita has effectively stagnated in recent years. Statistics Canada reports that output per person declined in five of the six quarters up to late 2023, leaving real GDP per capita near its 2017 level. An influx of over 1.2 million people in 2023 (a 3.2% population rise, roughly equivalent to adding a city the size of Calgary) – driven by record permanent and temporary immigration – meant population growth far outpaced output, pushing GDP per capita 2.5% below its pre-pandemic level. In short, Canada is growing the economy in quantity, but not quality: total GDP rises while average incomes and productivity languish.",

        title: "Growth via Immigration and Credentials at the Expense of Wages and Matching",
        content: "This essay offers a rigorous critique of Canada's current labour-economic model. First, it examines how overreliance on immigration and credential-heavy education as growth drivers has come at the expense of wage gains, effective skills utilization, and matching workers to good jobs. Second, it situates the notion of \"economic coercion\" of labour by drawing on historical precedents – the labour mobilization strategies of authoritarian regimes like Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union – to frame how systemic pressures can compel work (without equating Canada to those regimes). Third, contemporary survey data are discussed which show that majorities of Canadian and American workers would scale back or quit work if they were financially secure, suggesting much work today is performed out of economic necessity rather than choice. Fourth, we present evidence of a deteriorating labour share of income in Canada – with corporate profits at record highs and real wages largely stagnant – indicating that workers are not reaping proportional benefits from growth. Fifth, we analyze mismatches in Canada's high-immigration model, including sectoral skills underutilization and regional strains such as housing and infrastructure shortfalls in immigrant-destination cities. Finally, the essay explores forward-thinking policy alternatives – including empirical research on universal basic income (UBI) experiments and four-day workweek trials – that point toward a more equitable and human-centered economic model. The tone throughout is assertive but evidence-based, blending political-economic critique with policy analysis."

    conclusion: "The current economic model in Canada, while successful in growing aggregate GDP, has failed to deliver meaningful improvements in individual prosperity and productivity. A shift toward more human-centered economic policies, including UBI and reduced work hours, could provide a path forward toward a more equitable and sustainable economic future."
