  "description": "The study of energy in its many forms involves thermodynamic principles. Basic concepts of work, heat, properties of perfect gases and pure substances will be addressed. The first law of thermodynamics will be applied to practical systems like compressors, turbines, nozzles and others to implement the concept of energy conversion. Basic power cycles will be analysed and the performance merit to be determined. The various modes of heat transfer will be practiced and applied to simple situations. Cross-referenced to the National Technology Benchmarks (NTB).",
