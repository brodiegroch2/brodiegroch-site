          title: "Background and Ownership",
          content: "Bearspaw Golf & Country Club (now operating as Bearspaw Golf Club) has undergone a dramatic turnaround since 2019. The club, established in 1983, encountered severe financial trouble due to a costly clubhouse reconstruction project in the late 2010s. After several budget overruns, members refused to fund further \"cash calls,\" leading the club to cease operations in May 2019. The club was placed into receivership by the Court of Queen's Bench on application of its primary lender, TD Bank (which was owed about $10.4 million at the time). All but a skeleton staff were let go as of May 1, 2019, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed as receiver to seek a buyer. By late 2019, a rescue group comprised of former members and local investors – Bearspaw Equity Ventures Ltd. (BEVL) – purchased the club's assets out of receivership. BEVL is a private, for-profit corporation with 13 investors (mostly long-time club members). The new owners rebranded the facility as Bearspaw Golf Club and set about completing the stalled clubhouse and rejuvenating operations.\n\nUnder BEVL's stewardship (effective 2020 onwards), Bearspaw shifted from a member-owned model to an investor-owned model. This means members no longer hold equity stakes, and governance is through a board of the ownership group, not the general membership. Professional management was initially provided via a third-party (Windmill Golf) through 2022, but the club brought management in-house from 2023 onward to better control costs and service quality. According to BEVL's board chairman (Alan Norris), this change allowed more responsive, tailored operations and strict financial discipline – vital lessons after the previous failure. In summary, the club emerged from bankruptcy as a leaner enterprise with fresh capital and a mandate to rebuild membership and financial stability."

          title: "Membership Profile and Revenue Streams",
          content: "Bearspaw has rebounded strongly in membership since reopening. In mid-2020 (the first season post-receivership), the club had only 110 primary members (approximately 230 total including family members) who had re-joined under the new ownership. By the end of the 2022 season, membership had grown to around 325 primary members (i.e. full golfing members) enjoying the club with their families. This growth continued into 2023–2024, and management has indicated a target capacity in the mid-400s (approximately 450 full-play members) for a fully private club. In a 2022 industry posting, the club reported about 260 memberships sold to date, with a long-term goal of 500 memberships (likely including all categories). These figures demonstrate a strong post-resurgence trajectory – essentially tripling the member count from the initial base – reflecting renewed confidence in Bearspaw's offerings. The club remains not yet at full capacity, but the gap is closing each season. Management's goal is to eventually convert Bearspaw back to a private members-only model once the membership rolls are near capacity (eliminating public play).\n\nBearspaw offers several membership tiers to cater to different needs. The primary category is a Full Golf Membership, which grants unlimited play for the member (and typically privileges for their spouse and children). As of 2023, the club also heavily promoted a \"Trial Membership\" program: a one-season trial that gives full member access without a long-term commitment. The trial has been used to attract new members – for the 2023 season it was priced at roughly $5,850, later rising to $6,250 (plus GST) due to high demand. This fee covers the entire season's dues for a family and allows the trial member to \"test drive\" the club. If trial members choose to join as full members, a portion of the trial fee (e.g. a $1,000 credit) is applied toward the membership initiation deposit.\n\nFull Membership at Bearspaw requires an initiation or membership deposit (a one-time fee) plus annual dues. The club has not publicly disclosed the exact initiation fee, but the trial program credit implies a deposit on the order of tens of thousands of dollars (commonly around $10–20 k at comparable private clubs). This deposit is non-refundable and contributes to the club's capital fund. In exchange, full members pay lower annual dues than trial members and gain long-term security of membership. Annual membership dues themselves are in the mid four-figure range. For context, the trial fee (~$6.25k) essentially reflects one year of dues; hence one can infer regular annual dues for a full member are of a similar magnitude (on the order of $6,000 per year for a single/family).\n\nBearspaw also offers Family memberships (with spouse/junior privileges bundled) and Corporate memberships. Corporate memberships allow a company to designate multiple users and typically involve a higher initiation fee for transferable passes. According to a 2020 press release, Bearspaw was \"offering multiple membership opportunities including options for families, corporations, and individuals\" and even reciprocal playing privileges at other courses during its initial relaunch phase. (Reciprocal access was arranged with sister clubs like Heritage Pointe and Mickelson National while under Windmill's management, though those agreements may evolve now that Bearspaw is independently managed.)\n\nJunior and social membership categories are limited at Bearspaw – the club is primarily a golf club (not a full country club with extensive non-golf amenities), so the focus is on golfing members. However, juniors can participate in member programs and the club runs junior camps and lessons. Overall, Bearspaw's membership strategy has been to lower barriers to entry post-restructuring (via trial memberships and moderate initiation fees) and then steadily increase prices as the club nears full capacity. This is evidenced by the trial membership cost increase in 2023 and likely further initiation fee increases as membership slots fill up.\n\nIn the interim period while membership is still growing, Bearspaw operates as a semi-private club. This means non-members are allowed to play on a limited basis and generate additional revenue. Specifically, the course permits public tee times on weekdays (Monday–Thursday) for \"member for a day\" guests. The current unaccompanied guest green fee is $155 for 18 holes on weekdays (with discounts for juniors). Power cart rentals are an extra ~$27.50 per player. Twilight rounds (after 4:30pm) are offered at about $125 including cart. Members can also bring guests at a preferential rate (slightly lower than the public rate). These green fee rates position Bearspaw at the premium end of Calgary's public golf market, reflecting the championship quality of the course.\n\nWhile membership dues are Bearspaw's primary revenue source, public play contributes a meaningful secondary revenue stream. For example, if the club sells a few thousand public rounds per season (e.g. ~1,500–2,000 rounds, given weekday availability and high demand during Calgary's May–Oct golf season), it could generate on the order of $200–300 thousand in green fee revenue (155$ × rounds, plus cart fees). The Cochrane Eagle reported that 2020 was an \"absolutely crazy season\" for play, with tee sheets booked solid from 7am to 8:30pm daily during the summer. This was partly due to COVID-19 making golf one of the few available activities, but it underscored the club's ability to attract play.\n\nManagement has stated the club will continue to welcome public golfers until membership levels are sufficient to go private again. Importantly, the incremental revenue from public play helps cover operating costs while the membership base is still ramping up. In a full private scenario (once ~450 members are on board), the club might eliminate public tee times, but at that stage the lost green fee revenue would be offset by having ~100+ more dues-paying members than today.\n\nBearspaw's brand-new clubhouse has significantly expanded the club's food & beverage and event capabilities. The clubhouse features a full-service restaurant and bar, open not only to members but to the public as well. In fact, the clubhouse restaurant actively welcomes everyone – it's listed on OpenTable and open 7 days a week during golf season. The dining room can seat up to 250 guests and includes indoor and patio seating with beautiful views of the course and mountains. Typical entree prices range from ~$30–50 (mid-range fine dining). This indicates the restaurant is a significant operation in its own right, likely generating substantial revenue especially on evenings and weekends. Bearspaw markets the clubhouse as a community gathering spot, not just a members' lounge – \"everyone is welcome\" for a drink or dinner, which helps drive public patronage.\n\nBearspaw's new 30,000 ft² clubhouse features modern dining and event facilities. The club can host banquets up to ~200 people and daily dining for members and the public.\n\nIn addition to daily dining, the clubhouse was designed with event space for banquets, tournaments, weddings and corporate functions. It offers banquet capacity for up to 200 guests in a dedicated event hall. There are also smaller private dining rooms and a large patio for social events. This gives Bearspaw the ability to host weddings and large tournaments – events which can bring in significant one-time revenues (a single wedding, for example, can easily generate $15–$30k in food, beverage, and venue fees).\n\nWeddings and events have become a notable revenue category for many golf clubs; Bearspaw's modern facilities position it well in this market. The club's marketing highlights the banquet/conference amenities and \"spectacular mountain views\" as a draw for event bookings. While specific F&B revenue figures aren't public, we can make an informed estimation: if the restaurant operates at a moderate capacity and the club hosts numerous events, annual F&B revenues could reasonably be in the low seven figures (perhaps on the order of $1–2 million). This assumes a few hundred dollars of monthly dining spend per member household plus revenues from outside diners and event catering. Importantly, F&B at private clubs is often run near break-even to enhance member experience, but as a semi-private for-profit club, Bearspaw will aim for a modest profit margin from these operations. The OpenTable listing and the facility's size underscore that Bearspaw's dining is a key part of the club's value proposition and revenue mix.\n\nRounds of golf and dining tend to be the dominant revenue streams, but Bearspaw also has others in the mix: a Golf Shop on site (retailing apparel, equipment, and accessories), instruction programs (lessons, clinics, junior camps), and rentals (club rentals, locker rentals). The club's pro shop is fully stocked and likely does a healthy business outfitting members and guests. There is also an indoor golf facility with two TrackMan-powered simulators inside the clubhouse, which members and guests can book for a fee (especially popular in off-season months).\n\nWhile these are relatively smaller contributors, they round out the enterprise's income. For a comprehensive valuation, one would note that merchandise sales typically have low margins and are often more of a member service. Lesson revenue largely goes to the golf professionals but can generate some club income. Overall, these \"other\" revenues are incremental but not major – probably in the low hundreds of thousands per year combined."

          title: "Operating Costs and Profitability",
          content: "Operating a high-end golf club is an expensive endeavor, and Bearspaw's cost base includes: golf course maintenance, clubhouse operations, staffing, and general administration. The golf course maintenance alone (mowing 200 acres, irrigation, turf care, equipment upkeep) is a significant annual expense likely approaching seven figures. Under the previous ownership, maintenance costs spiked due to capital projects (the course remained in decent shape but the incomplete clubhouse was a drain). Under new ownership, maintenance has continued at a high standard – the course conditions are touted as \"exceptional\" – but the club must carefully manage these costs relative to member dues.\n\nThe clubhouse operations now include food and beverage service (with kitchen and serving staff), utilities for a 30,000 ft² facility, and maintenance of the building and grounds. Utilities and facility upkeep for such a large building can easily run in the hundreds of thousands per year (heating, cooling, cleaning, repairs, property taxes, insurance, etc.). Bearspaw's staffing in total likely comprises: a grounds crew, golf operations staff (pro shop, starters, marshals), food & beverage staff (chefs, servers, bartenders), and administrative/management personnel. In the immediate aftermath of receivership, the club ran very lean (only 5 staff were kept on to maintain the course during receivership). Since reopening, staff levels have ramped up in line with the new facilities and membership growth. By 2025, the club would employ dozens of seasonal and full-time employees to deliver the member experience. Labor is one of the largest operating expenses in any service business, and a club of Bearspaw's scale would have an annual payroll in the millions (including course maintenance labor, clubhouse staff, and management).\n\nThe new owners have emphasized stringent financial discipline after the club's prior collapse. Alan Norris (BEVL's board chair) noted that keeping cost structures in line with reality was a key lesson learned. In practice, this means Bearspaw likely re-budgeted all departments from scratch in 2020, trimming any excess. For example, they outsourced management to Windmill Golf initially, possibly to leverage economies of scale in purchasing and staffing across multiple courses. However, by 2023 they chose not to renew that contract, instead hiring their own General Manager and bringing operations in-house. This suggests confidence that they can run the club more cost-effectively on their own.\n\nNorris also mentioned that delivering a high-quality experience is crucial since members have many choices on where to spend discretionary dollars – implying the club must balance cost-cutting with maintaining top-notch service and conditions. One visible cost-saving measure: during the receivership period, capital spending was halted. BEVL had to finish the clubhouse construction in 2020, but since then there have been no reports of major new capital projects (the focus is on recouping that investment). Also, while the club initially allowed unlimited public play to boost revenue, it has carefully controlled that so as not to compromise the member experience (e.g., limiting public tee times to weekdays only). This balance ensures members remain satisfied – reducing the risk of attrition, which could harm financial stability.\n\nPrecise profitability figures for Bearspaw are not publicly disclosed (as a private company, BEVL does not publish financials). However, we can infer the general picture. In the first couple of years post-acquisition (2020–2021), the club likely operated around break-even or at a slight loss. This is common for a turnaround situation: membership dues were still ramping up to cover the full fixed cost base, and the clubhouse completion in 2020–21 was a major one-time expense. Indeed, BEVL likely injected capital to cover operating deficits initially (better than the old model of cash calls to members).\n\nBy 2022–2023, with 300+ dues-paying members and all facilities open (and with pandemic golf participation boom), the club's operating cash flow would have improved significantly. Management's statements are optimistic: they describe Bearspaw now as \"a vibrant club with a bright future\", and stress that having a unified vision and the right management has enhanced the member experience and operational efficiency. This suggests that by 2023 the club may have achieved a modest positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization).\n\nAny EBITDA is likely being reinvested in the club (e.g. paying down any remaining debt, building cash reserves, or funding smaller capital improvements), as is typical for clubs focusing on quality. For context, many private golf clubs operate on thin margins – a 0%–10% EBITDA margin is common – essentially plowing most revenue back into operations or member amenities. Bearspaw's for-profit mandate might target a small profit, but given the large depreciation from the new clubhouse and ongoing high service levels, substantial net profits are unlikely at this stage.\n\nA reasonable assumption is that annual revenues (membership dues, green fees, F&B, etc.) now roughly match annual operating costs, with perhaps a small surplus if membership continues to grow. Once the club fills its membership roster (~450 members), annual dues revenue will increase further (potentially an extra $700k–$1 million per year compared to current levels), which should translate largely into bottom-line improvement since fixed costs are already covered. In the long run, Bearspaw's investors presumably expect a return via either distributions from future profits or increased enterprise value of the club.\n\nOne notable financial advantage Bearspaw has post-restructuring is the absence of legacy debt service. During the insolvency, the costly bank loans were cleared (creditors took losses or were paid out from the sale). The new clubhouse, though expensive, was paid for by the new owners' capital infusion rather than entirely by new loans (no public evidence of a large mortgage in 2020–2021). This means the club is not weighed down by interest payments on a $10+ million loan, which greatly helps its cash flow. Essentially, BEVL's equity investment replaced what was unsustainable debt in the old structure. This de-levered balance sheet gives Bearspaw a chance to succeed financially where the prior entity failed.\n\nTo summarize operating performance: Bearspaw has likely moved from an unsustainable, cash-starved operation in 2019 to a stable, solvent business in 2025, covering its operating costs through member dues and ancillary revenues. While exact EBITDA is unknown, the club's leadership asserts that with proper cost control and a growing membership base, the financial outlook is positive. The emphasis on internal management and member experience indicates that any efficiency gains are being pursued not by cutting quality, but by smarter management and achieving scale with more members."

          title: "Debt and Financing History",
          content: "Under the former Bearspaw Country Club Ltd., the club accumulated significant debt related to its capital project and operations. The primary creditor was Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), which provided financing (likely a mortgage or construction loan) and was owed approximately $10.4 million at receivership."

          title: "Real Estate and Facilities",
          content: "Bearspaw Golf Club occupies a substantial real estate holding in a desirable area just northwest of Calgary. The property spans over 200 acres of rolling foothills terrain, offering scenic views of the Rocky Mountains. The club's address (61 Hamilton Drive) is in Rocky View County on Calgary's edge – an area known for upscale acreage homes and country estates. The zoning is for recreational use (golf course) and the land includes the 18-hole championship course, practice areas, water features, and now the new clubhouse complex. The course itself, designed by Bill Newis, has been a fixture for 40+ years, meaning the landscaping and course infrastructure (irrigation system, drainage, etc.) are well-established assets on the land.\n\nFrom a real estate perspective, the land value of 200 acres in that location is significant. Raw agricultural land in the Bearspaw area can easily fetch five-figure sums per acre, and land with development potential for country residential lots can go much higher. However, because this land is dedicated to a golf use (and likely encumbered by its use as a club in the county's development plan), it may not be freely convertible to housing without a lengthy rezoning – something the owners have not pursued. Thus, the highest and best use of the property is currently as a golf course, not as subdivided real estate. That said, the expansive acreage and scenic quality provide an intrinsic \"floor value\" to the enterprise – essentially, the club is backed by a large tangible asset. The new owners own the land and facilities outright (unlike some clubs that lease land). There are no known land leases or property rent payments; Bearspaw's site is held in fee simple by BEVL (via the acquired assets of the old company). This means any long-term appreciation in land values could benefit the club's owners.\n\nThe crown jewel of Bearspaw's facilities is its brand-new clubhouse, completed in 2021. This clubhouse is a 30,000 square-foot modern building, designed by Davignon Martin Architecture, that replaces the former outdated clubhouse. It was built to a high standard (often described as one of the finest in Calgary) at an approximate cost of $25 million. The clubhouse's amenities include: a large banquet hall (200-person capacity), an upscale casual restaurant and bar (125+ seating indoors, plus patio), conference/meeting rooms, and an open-air conservatory for socializing. For golfers, there are luxurious locker rooms (men's and ladies' locker facilities, spa-inspired, with lounges), a fully-equipped Pro Shop, and services like club storage and shoe shine. The clubhouse has also become the year-round hub of activity thanks to two indoor golf simulators (TrackMan/TopTracer systems) installed, allowing members to practice and play virtual rounds during winter. In essence, this clubhouse is a brand-new capital asset that significantly enhances the club's value and revenue potential (through dining and events). It also carries with it a large depreciation expense on the books, but one that does not require cash outlay going forward since it's already built and paid for.\n\nAdjacent to the clubhouse is the practice facility, which was completely rebuilt as part of the revitalization. Bearspaw now boasts a state-of-the-art driving range outfitted with Toptracer technology (in-bay screens/radar so golfers can track their shots – an increasingly popular feature). There is a dedicated short-game area with bunkers and greens for chipping and putting practice. These practice amenities are top-tier and comparable to those at elite private clubs, adding to the membership value. The practice range reconstruction was part of the owners' investment (some portion of that $25M project went into grading and installing the new range and TrackMan tech).\n\nThe golf course itself is an 18-hole championship course originally opened in 1984. It plays to a challenging layout with water features and rolling terrain, and it has long been regarded as one of Calgary's better courses. While the course routing and greens remain largely as originally built, continuous capital upkeep is required: irrigation systems, turf replacements, cart paths, etc. There haven't been news of a major course redesign, so we can assume the course infrastructure is in mature, good condition. However, the course maintenance equipment is an important asset category. In the insolvency, as noted, John Deere Financial had a lien, implying the club had a relatively new fleet of mowers or utility vehicles around 2016–2017. The fate of that equipment through receivership isn't fully detailed, but likely the new owners either assumed those leases or purchased the needed equipment. Today, Bearspaw presumably has a full complement of modern turf equipment (greens mowers, fairway mowers, sprayers, etc.) either owned or financed. The golf cart fleet is another asset: typically a club will have 40–60 electric carts for member/public use. CWB National Leasing's lien from 2018 could have been related to carts (for instance, leasing 50 new carts). If those leases expired, Bearspaw may have entered a new lease or purchase for carts around 2020. Carts are often turned over every 5 years or so. In valuation, these equipment assets (while costly, easily over $500k total) are considered as part of the operational assets of the club. They depreciate fast but are necessary for the business.\n\nNo formal appraisal of the club's property has been published since the restructuring. However, one can triangulate a sense of value. Pre-bankruptcy, the club's assessed value (for property tax) would have accounted for the partially built structure and land use. With the new clubhouse, the assessed value likely jumped. Rocky View County's assessment might value the land and improvements in the tens of millions. For instance, just the 30k sq ft building at replacement cost $25M and 200 acres at perhaps $8–12M (at ~$40–60k/acre for golf use) could sum to an assessed value around $30–35 million. Of course, market value can differ from cost-based assessments, especially since a golf club's value is ultimately tied to its ability to generate income.\n\nIn terms of comparable sales: pure golf course sales in Alberta are infrequent. One data point: in 2021, the semi-private Redwood Meadows Golf Club (outside Calgary) was transferred to a First Nation for ~$1.9M plus debt assumption – but that was a unique scenario on leased land with flood damage history. Bearspaw's situation (prime land, brand-new facilities) is entirely different. It more closely resembles a \"trophy asset\" club that might appeal to either wealthy individuals or consortiums. If we consider what it cost to create Bearspaw as it is today – roughly $10–12M (purchase + paying off creditors) + $15M (to finish the clubhouse and improvements) – the owners are in for around ~$25–27M. That can serve as a baseline for its value (they would presumably not sell for less than their investment unless performance disappoints).\n\nIn summary, Bearspaw's real estate and facilities are a major source of value. The club now offers: a premier course on 200+ scenic acres, a brand-new 30k ft² clubhouse with extensive amenities, and modern golf practice facilities and equipment. These physical assets not only enhance the member experience but also underpin the club's valuation (both in asset-based valuations and in supporting the revenue generation for income-based valuations). The combination of land and new improvements makes Bearspaw one of the most substantial golf properties in the Calgary region – an important point when assessing its enterprise value."

          title: "Legal and Regulatory Considerations",
          content: "The key legal event in Bearspaw's recent history was the 2019 receivership and bankruptcy process, which has been thoroughly resolved. Upon BEVL's purchase of the club assets in October 2019 (approved by the court), the club emerged with a new legal entity and no ongoing litigation from the old company's collapse. PwC's receivership proceedings included Court orders (e.g. an Approval and Vesting Order) that transferred the property to the new owners free of encumbrances. This means any prior claims (from unpaid contractors, tax authorities, etc.) were either dealt with in receivership or extinguished against the assets. There were three lien claims registered before receivership (TD, John Deere, CWB); all of these were addressed as part of the sale and are no longer attached to the club's property or operations. Creditors who were not fully paid out would have been left behind with the insolvent old company (Bearspaw Country Club Ltd.), which was likely assigned into bankruptcy following the receivership sale (the insolvency insider report notes the receivership was initiated May 16, 2019, implying the old company has since been dissolved or remains only as a shell in bankruptcy). For practical purposes, Bearspaw Golf Club (BGC) as operated by BEVL has a clean legal slate starting 2020.\n\nSince then, there have been no public reports of major legal disputes involving the club. No lawsuits by contractors or members are known – those would typically have surfaced in news if significant. It appears the new owners honored their commitments (for example, they refunded the $10k deposits that a handful of old members had put into trust for the failed cash call, as the board promised to do). There haven't been any labour or employment disputes reported, nor any regulatory violations. The club must comply with normal regulations: health codes for the restaurant, safety regulations, liquor licensing (serving alcohol on site), and environmental regulations (e.g. regarding water use for irrigation and fertilizer runoff). Bearspaw is subject to Alberta Environment guidelines for courses (to ensure protection of waterways etc.), but there's no indication of any issues there.\n\nOne regulatory matter to note: property taxes. As a for-profit entity, Bearspaw pays property tax to Rocky View County. While not \"legal\" in the sense of courts, it is an obligation. The new high-value improvements likely increased the property tax considerably post-2021. However, the club would have accounted for that in its financial planning. Sometimes, private clubs have to worry about municipal zoning or noise bylaws (especially if hosting events or being open to the public at night). No complaints or constraints on Bearspaw have been made public, likely because the club is in a semi-rural area with its closest neighbors also being part of the golf community or acreages set far apart.\n\nAnother aspect is memberships as contracts. Members typically sign an agreement or are subject to bylaws that outline their dues, rights, and the club's rights (for instance, the club's right to change policies or the refundable portion of any fees – in Bearspaw's case, initiation deposits are non-refundable and annual dues are payable in advance). Legally, Bearspaw's membership documents are not publicly available, but given industry standards, it's likely each member signs a membership agreement with BEVL or the club entity, which is straightforward. Since BEVL is for-profit, members do not vote on club financial decisions (unlike the old structure where members/shareholders could vote, as they did to reject the cash call). This lack of member governance is actually a legal simplification – it reduces the risk of internal disputes because the owners have clear authority. To date, there are no known legal challenges from members regarding this structure; presumably, all current members joined knowing the club is privately owned and that their fees do not confer ownership.\n\nIn conclusion, no outstanding legal liabilities or lawsuits weigh on Bearspaw as of 2025. The club's legal environment is stable: the past insolvency is closed, and ongoing obligations (taxes, licenses, member contracts) are routine. This clean legal profile adds confidence for valuation purposes, as any potential buyer or analyst can see the club is not entangled in litigation or unsolved claims. The only caveat is that the club's value is contingent on maintaining good regulatory standing (e.g., retaining its liquor license and land use permissions), but there's no sign of trouble in those areas. Bearspaw's resurrection was done by the book, legally speaking, leaving the enterprise free of legacy encumbrances that could hinder its value."

          title: "Valuation Analysis and Estimate",
          content: "Determining an enterprise valuation for Bearspaw Golf & Country Club as of mid-2025 requires balancing two approaches: an asset-based approach (summing the value of land and improvements) and an income-based approach (based on cash flow/EBITDA). We will use the data gathered on revenues, expenses, and assets to triangulate a credible valuation range, while noting assumptions and limitations.\n\nAsset-Based Perspective: On a pure asset basis, Bearspaw has roughly $30–35 million invested in tangible assets. This includes about $25 million for the new clubhouse (per reported construction cost), plus the golf course land and improvements. The 200+ acres of land in Bearspaw could be valued around $10–15 million in the current market for recreational land (for instance, even valuing the land at a conservative $50k/acre yields $10M; higher if considering proximity to Calgary). The course itself (greens, irrigation, etc.) and practice facilities are part of that land value but also represent a significant replacement cost – building a new course today could cost another $5–10M easily. However, asset value must be adjusted for the reality that a golf course as a going concern cannot simply be liquidated for full land value (especially if zoning is restrictive). The liquidation value of Bearspaw's assets would be far lower than their replacement cost – no one is going to buy a 200-acre golf property just to sell turf and concrete. Thus, asset values set a top-end ceiling for valuation rather than a direct market price. BEVL's total investment (~$25M+) effectively represents what it cost to create the current Bearspaw. In a healthy market, one would hope the club could be sold for at least that if not more, assuming the business is now stabilized.\n\nIncome-Based Perspective: A more pertinent valuation method for an ongoing club is to look at its earning power. As discussed, Bearspaw's annual revenues might be on the order of $4 million (rough breakdown: ~$2.5M from member dues, $0.3M green fees, $1–1.5M F&B/events, plus misc). Annual operating expenses are likely of similar magnitude, given the current near break-even state. If we project a few years ahead, with full membership, revenues could rise to perhaps $5M and expenses might increase to say $4M, yielding an EBITDA in the ballpark of $1M (these are speculative figures for illustration). The valuation of a private golf club's cash flow is tricky – such clubs are not typically valued on high earnings multiples because they are lifestyle businesses with heavy capital needs. However, if one were to apply a multiple, one might use a capitalization rate or EBITDA multiple suited for hospitality/leisure assets. It's common to see golf courses trade at relatively low multiples (5× to 8× EBITDA) unless they have substantial development upside. For example, a course consistently netting $1M might sell for $5–8M. In Bearspaw's case, the EBITDA in 2025 is likely small (possibly a few hundred thousand at best), since they are reinvesting and not yet at full membership capacity. Even if we optimistically annualize a future EBITDA of $1M, using a mid-range multiple of ~7× gives $7 million enterprise value. This is well below the asset-based value, reflecting the reality that pure financial buyers won't pay for unused capacity or trophy features that don't directly increase profit. It highlights that much of Bearspaw's value to owners is in intangible/lifestyle factors (prestige, long-term land appreciation, enjoyment of the club) rather than immediate profits.\n\nReconciliation – What is Bearspaw worth? The most accurate valuation estimate likely lies somewhere between the asset value and income value, leaning toward asset value given the stage of the club. Bearspaw is a unique case where the owners have poured in capital to create a top-class facility; they will expect a valuation that recognizes this investment even if current cash flows are modest. At the same time, any buyer or investor would look at the club's ability to generate returns over time. Considering all factors, we estimate Bearspaw's enterprise value in June 2025 to be on the order of CAD $20–25 million (mid-eight figures). This range is justified as follows:\n• The lower bound (~$20M) would imply the club is valued mainly on current financial performance, acknowledging that it is not yet at full earning potential. It roughly corresponds to writing off some of the recent investment as \"overbuilding\" relative to immediate needs. A $20M valuation might be viewed as conservative, perhaps what an investor would pay if they only expect a modest profit growth or if they perceive some ongoing risk in the golf market. It's also close to the rough amount of debt that was cleared (old $10M) plus partial clubhouse cost, meaning it's the value of tangible assets minus a heavy discount for business risk.\n• The upper bound (~$25M) essentially values the club at about its total reconstruction cost (land + clubhouse). Reaching this value would assume the club is now a proven enterprise with a clear path to profitability (or that a strategic buyer values the prestige and long-term control of the asset highly). At $25M, one would be paying approximately $1M per hole or $125k per member (if ~200 active memberships at time of valuation) – which is on the high side but not unheard of for premium clubs. This upper bound might be achievable if, for example, a competing luxury club or a real estate developer saw strategic value (though in Bearspaw's case the land's development potential is limited by the intention to keep it as a golf club).\n\nOur midpoint estimate (~$22–23M) aligns with the notion that Bearspaw's intrinsic value has risen substantially from the dark days of 2019, but is still catching up to the money invested. In other words, BEVL has likely created value (the club is worth more now as a going concern than the ~$10–12M they paid to acquire a distressed asset), but they may not yet have full dollar-for-dollar recovery on the additional ~$15M capital sunk into improvements. Over the coming years, if the club fills to capacity and perhaps increases initiation fees (which are essentially pure profit when sold), the economics improve. For instance, selling 100 more memberships at, say, $20k each deposit would bring in $2M – directly boosting value. Likewise, if the club can eventually generate $1M/year in EBITDA, the valuation would firm up around $20M just from an income perspective (assuming ~20% ROI expectation for such an asset).\n\nAssumptions and Limitations: It's important to note the assumptions behind this valuation. We assume no significant hidden liabilities (e.g., we are not aware of any environmental remediation needed, or pending lawsuits, etc. – and we have found none in the public record). We assume the business will continue as a golf club and not be repurposed; a drastic change like rezoning the land for housing could theoretically multiply the land value, but that's outside the scope of an \"enterprise valuation\" for the golf club as a going concern. We also assume a normal operating environment (no new pandemics shutting down operations, for example). The valuation is in 2025 dollars and reflects the current market sentiment for golf clubs, which is relatively positive given the post-COVID interest in golf. However, golf clubs are not highly liquid assets – finding the right buyer can take time and there are limited comparables, which means our estimate has a wider uncertainty band than, say, a straightforward real estate appraisal.\n\nOne limitation is the lack of precise EBITDA figures from Bearspaw's financials; our estimate of $20–25M is heavily influenced by asset values and qualitative factors rather than a precise earnings multiple. Another consideration is membership value: at member-owned clubs, one can look at the price of membership sales (shares) as a proxy for value. At Bearspaw, memberships are not freely traded securities, but the initiation fee level does signal perceived value. Currently initiation is relatively low (probably <$20k), which suggests the club is still in a value-building phase – in Calgary, top-tier private clubs (e.g. Calgary G&CC or Glencoe) have much higher effective buy-in costs (sometimes $30k–$50k). As Bearspaw's reputation rebuilds, if it were to command such initiation fees, that would indicate an upward trajectory in enterprise value as well. Our valuation implicitly assumes Bearspaw is still discounting membership to fill up, rather than pricing at the very top of the market.\n\nTo double-check our valuation range, consider replacement cost: If one attempted to create a similar club from scratch – buying 200 acres near Calgary, building a course and 30k sq ft clubhouse – it would likely cost well over $30M (land acquisition plus construction). So our ~$22M mid-point suggests Bearspaw is currently valued below its replacement cost, which actually makes sense given it is not yet fully mature in membership. This is common in the club industry; new capital investments often take years to recoup. The current owners likely accept that dynamic, aiming for long-term payoff."
        }
      ],
      conclusion: "Taking all available information into account, Bearspaw Golf & Country Club's enterprise value in June 2025 is most reasonably estimated around $22 million (CAD), with a plausible range from about $20M to $25M. This valuation is supported by the club's substantial real assets (200 acres of land and a $25M clubhouse) and its re-established revenue stream from ~325+ growing membership base."
