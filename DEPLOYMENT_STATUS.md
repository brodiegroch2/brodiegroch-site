## 🔄 Current Status

**Code Status:** ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub  
**Deployment Status:** ⏳ Waiting for Vercel auto-deploy  
**OpenAPI Spec:** ✅ Updated in both locations

## 🚨 About the 403 Error

The 403 Forbidden error you're seeing is likely due to one of these:

### 1. Deployment Not Complete
Your latest changes may not be live yet. Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub, but it takes a few minutes.

**How to Check:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for the latest deployment including commit `fb64e2c`
5. Ensure it shows "Ready" status

### 2. OpenAPI Spec Mismatch
The GPT connector might be using an outdated OpenAPI spec.

**How to Fix:**
1. In your Custom GPT configuration
2. Go to Actions
3. Remove the old OpenAPI spec import
4. Re-import from: `https://brodiegroch.ca/openapi-spec.yaml`

## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
Wait 2-5 minutes for Vercel to complete deployment, then try again.

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
Test the API manually:
```bash
curl -X POST https://brodiegroch.ca/api/data/courses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "Course ID": "MET250",
    "Course Name": "Test Course",
    "Credit Hours": "3"
  }'
```

### Step 3: Update OpenAPI in GPT
1. Open Custom GPT configuration
2. Go to Actions
3. Remove current OpenAPI spec
4. Add new action
5. Import from URL: `https://brodiegroch.ca/openapi-spec.yaml`

### Step 4: Update GPT Instructions
Copy the contents of `CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_CONCISE.md` and paste into Custom GPT Instructions.

## 🔍 Why Field Normalization Matters

The GPT connector sends field names with underscores:
```json
{
  "Course___ID": "MET250",
  "Site___Name": "Brightspace"
}
```

Our API now automatically converts these to spaces:
```json
{
  "Course ID": "MET250",
  "Site Name": "Brightspace"
}
```

This means the API accepts both formats!

## 📝 Testing Checklist

Once deployed, test these operations:

- [ ] GET /api/data/courses (should return 200)
- [ ] POST /api/data/courses (should return 201, requires approval)
- [ ] GET /api/data/quick-links (should return 200)
- [ ] POST /api/data/quick-links (should return 201, requires approval)
- [ ] GET /api/data/deliverables (should return 200)
- [ ] PUT /api/data/deliverables (should return 200, requires approval)

## 🎯 What to Expect

**When you create a course:**
1. GPT prompts you for approval ✅
2. You review the details ✅
3. You approve ✅
4. API normalizes field names automatically ✅
5. Course is created with status 201 ✅

**The 403 error should be resolved once deployment completes.**

## 📞 If Issues Persist

If you still get 403 after deployment:
1. Check Vercel logs for errors
2. Verify the OpenAPI spec is up to date
3. Try recreating the Custom GPT action
4. Test API directly with curl (bypasses GPT)

All code is ready - just waiting for deployment! 🚀
